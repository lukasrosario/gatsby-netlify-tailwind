  Gatsby + Netlify + Tailwind Starter
</h1>

## Getting Started

1.  **Deploy a copy to Netlify**

    <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/lukasrosario/gatsby-netlify-tailwind&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

2.  **Access Locally**

    Pull a local copy of the repository set up in the previous step and install dependencies.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
    $ cd [REPO_NAME]
    $ yarn
    ```

3.  **Start developing**

    Generate a production build of the site to use the CMS locally, and then start the development server.
    
    ```
    $ yarn run build
    $ netlify dev
    ```
    
This project was inspired by the [Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
